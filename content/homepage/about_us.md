Born in York, PA, to Robert & Tammi Nash. Jamie grew up on a farm surrounded by animals in southern York and has one sibling - Rebecca. Jamie has a contagious zest for life and her smile spreads among everyone she's with. After visiting over 30 countries, she is always looking forward to the next adventure by experiencing the culture and food of a new place. You'll often find Jamie begging Zach to get outside and go on a hike, play sports, or just be in "the outside place". Her obsession with vitamin D and her love for the warmth of the sun keeps them traveling like snowbirds to escape the cold dreary winters of Pennsylvania.

#### About Zach
![Zach](images/zach.jpeg)
_Technologist / Leader / Maven / Architect / Engineer / Solver of Problems / Adventure Enthusiast_

Born in Dixon, IL, to Joseph and Brenda Hill. Zach grew up surrounded by the outdoors and has one sibling - Cody. Zach has always had a passion for adventure. He grew up camping, hiking, fishing, and exploring the outdoors with his family. As a kid you'd find him walking the woods with friends and a hatchet building forts. As an adult, you'll find the same. If you go on a hike together, you'll likely find yourself on the path less traveled. He could talk for hours and hours about space and rocket launches, and would love to host a launch party for the upcoming Starship launch. Zach has a fierce passion for technology and will nerd out over the latest new thing for hours at a time, whether that be by watching Youtube videos, reading blogs, or talking to friends. He's always looking for the next big thing to learn.
