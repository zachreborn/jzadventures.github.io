#### The Scene
It began the morning of Saturday, September 30th, 2023 in Boulder, CO. Zach had planned out a weekend of hiking and exploration to pop the question. Our first stop was breakfast in Nederland, CO at [The Train Cars Coffee and Kava](http://www.thetraincarscoffee.com/). ![Train Cars](images/jz_train_cars.jpeg)

After breakfast, we headed to the trailhead nearby only to find that the road was closed by 7am due to all of the hikers. Feeling discouraged, we decided to wing it and look for another hike by heading north away from the city. We ended up going towards [Rocky Mountain National Park](https://www.nps.gov/romo/index.htm) and decided we'd see whether we could get in. As luck would have it, we purchased the final entry! We had some time to kill while we waited for our entry time and found ourselves in Estes Park, CO. We were on the hunt for a good stiff drink and found ourselves at [The Whiskey Bar](http://www.stanleyhotel.com/the-whiskey-bar.html) sharing a fantastic old fashioned. ![Old Fashioned](images/jz_old_fashioned.jpeg)

After our drink, we headed into the park and found a trail that looked promising. We hiked for a few miles before we found ourselves at a beautiful lake. We took a moment to enjoy the view, while Zach set up the camera and Jamie was enamored with a swimming duck in the waters nearby. After fiddling with the camera for a moment, Zach popped the question!

Jamie started with a laugh before exclaiming "Hell yes!"

**There is so much more to share, but we will save that for over a drink!**
